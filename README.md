# startup-auth .NET Core Web API JWT Auth
This web API provides you a simple JWT auth implementation for your startup or side projects. 👣
I'll maintain this project regularly because I am also using this web API as an auth system for my side projects. 💪🏽

(I know, you don't want to waste your time with ASP.NET Core Identity and it's HUGE abstraction for your side projects.) 🏔️
